# Projet-DevOps
## Description
In this DevOps project, I designed and implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline to streamline the development and deployment of applications in a virtualized environment. Using GitHub as the source code management platform, I automated the integration and delivery processes with Jenkins, ensuring consistent builds and testing. Applications were containerized using Docker and published to DockerHub for easy deployment. For orchestration, Kubernetes was employed to manage containerized workloads, while ArgoCD facilitated continuous delivery with GitOps principles. Code quality and security were maintained through SonarQube for static code analysis and Trivy for container vulnerability scanning. Maven was used to build and manage project dependencies, ensuring reliable and efficient builds. Finally, the application was deployed on virtual machines, simulating a real-world environment to ensure scalability, reliability, and performance. This project highlights expertise in automating workflows, enhancing code quality, and deploying secure, scalable solutions.
